Kraken Agent can be deployed in multiple ways. Here is present a new
way that leverages Docker Compose. It is not scalable as such agents
are run on the same machine but it is quick and simple and if we need
just to have one or two more agents this is a way to go.

### Starting in Docker Compose from QuickStart

To add such agents we will extend Docker Compose from
[QuickStart](quick-start).

There is already defined one built-in agent. But first, several
modifications are needed to solve IP addressing issues. The problem is
that it may get a different IP address after a container restart than
before. Kraken Server requires that the addresses do not change
otherwise it is not possible to identify agents by the Kraken Server.

First, open your compose file (e.g. kraken-docker-compose-X.Y.yaml)
and enable IP Address Management (IPAM) in the `lab_net` where all
agents reside:

```yaml
  ...
  lab_net:
    driver: bridge
    # add the following lines at the end of compose file
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

Here is added a subnet with particular addresses class,
`172.20.0.0/16`. You can define any subnet definition you need.

And now add extra agents by copy-pasting `agent` service:

```yaml
  agent1:
    restart: always
    image: us-docker.pkg.dev/kraken-261806/kk/kkagent:0.998
    environment:
      - KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR
      - KRAKEN_SERVER_ADDR
    networks:
      lab_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.0.11
    depends_on:
      - server
      - minio
      - clickhouse-proxy
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Important things:

1. New agent service name should be different e.g. `agent1`, `agent2`, etc.
2. Remove ` - KRAKEN_AGENT_BUILTIN=1` environment variable that can be only in one agent.
3. Add explicit IP address in `networks` section: `ipv4_address: 172.20.0.11`.
  Every new agent needs to have a different IP address.

Before running such a modified compose file, shut down the currently
running compose and delete `lab_net`.  To delete this network, first,
check if it exists:

```console
$ docker network ls
```

It should have name like this `<current-folder-name>_lab_net`. Please delete it:

```console
$ docker network rm <current-folder-name>_lab_net
```

Now you can start Docker Compose again. `lab_net` network will be
recreated with proper new settings:

```console
$ docker-compose --env-file kraken-X.Y.env -f kraken-docker-compose-X.Y.yaml up
```

Go to Discovered Agents page in Kraken Web UI and check if new agents
are present there.

That's it. You have new agents running.
