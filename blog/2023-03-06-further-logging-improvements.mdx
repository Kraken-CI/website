### Logs Retention Policy

The logs retention policy generally indicates how long logs should be
kept in the logs store ie. Clickhouse. It is possible to set these
policies on two levels: 1) global and 2) branch level. The time is
expressed in a number of months.

The picture below shows the `General Settings` tab where under the
`Global Log Retention Policy` section, it is possible to set the number
of months for how long all the logs (from Kraken Server and all
Agents) will be kept in Clickhouse.

The following picture shows the `Retention Policy` tab on a branch
management page. Here, a similar policy can be set for logs related to
this branch, either for CI flows or for Dev flows.

### Server Logs Presentation

New logs panel has been introduced. It can show logs from both the
server and agent sides. This panel can be found in several places that
are indicated in the pictures below.

Here a branch management page is presented with the `Logs` tab where
logs related to this branch are shown.
