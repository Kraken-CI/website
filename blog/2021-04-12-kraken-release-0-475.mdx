The 0.475 release contains three main features:

- presenting **changes in Git repository** that got into a given flow
- presenting **step duration** on Run page, on the selected job, on Steps tab

<!--truncate-->

## The last flows status on the Kraken main page

The Kraken main page presents a list of branches for each
project.  On the Demo project shown below, there are multiple
branches. Now under each branch, there are exposed the last completed
flow and the last in-progress flow. On the side, there is added a time
in grey how long ago the flow was completed or created.

## Git repo changes on a flow page

The flow can be triggered by a push to Github PR or a Git branch. Now
the flow page presents information about these Git changes.

If a push to Github PR triggered a flow, then it is presented
in **Repo Changes** tab on the flow page.

If a stage has a repository defined in a trigger section, then the changes
detected since previous flow are presented on another **Repo Changes**
tab for the selected stage.
