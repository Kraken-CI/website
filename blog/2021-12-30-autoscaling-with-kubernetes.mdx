Previous Kraken's release introduced a new installation method into Kubernetes using Helm chart.
Today's [0.813 release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.813)
allows for autoscaling on Kubernetes.

More information about Kraken on Kubernetes is below.

Autoscaling [docs](/docs/autoscale-in-cloud) have been
updated and now includes details about Kubernetes.

Additionally, a new [guide for Kubernetes](/docs/guide-kubernetes) has
been prepared.  It presents, step by step, how to deploy Kraken to
Kubernetes cluster, configure autoscaling on Kubernetes and how to run
the first job there.
