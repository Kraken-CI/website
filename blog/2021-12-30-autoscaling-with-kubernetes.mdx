Autoscaling [docs](/docs/autoscale-in-cloud) has been
update and now includes details about Kubernetes.

Additionally, a new [guide for Kubernetes](/docs/guide-kubernetes) has
been prepared.  It presents, step by step, how to deploy Kraken to
Kubernetes cluster, configure autoscaling on Kubernetes and how to run
the first job there.
