The 0.492 release contains one feature:

- status badges

and two fixes:

- fixed collecting commits info in case there are deleted files
- fixed returning tests results counts - mistake during code cleanup

<!--truncate-->

The status badges indicate the current quality of a branch of a project.

There are three types of badges. They are indicating:

- building state (if there are no errors)
- tests results with fixes and regression counts
- issues count with a count of newly discovered issues

Links to the badges are available on a branch management page, in the Status Badge tab:
