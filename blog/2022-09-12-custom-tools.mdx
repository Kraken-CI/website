There is a new way for extending Kraken CI: custom tools. A
[tool](/docs/tools) in Kraken CI provides particular functionality that is
used in steps in a workflow schema. Till now, there were only built-in
tools like `git` for checking out source code from Git repository, or
`artifacts` for storing or retrieving files from Kraken global
[storage](/docs/storage) or finally `shell` for running commands in a shell.

Custom tools allow for developing such tools by third parties, sharing
them with others and installing and using them in Kraken Server.

### Custom Tools Details

Docs for [custom tools](/docs/tools) first present the whole
architecture of Kraken CI with Agents and tools. Then the interaction
between Kraken Agent and a tool is shown with an example tool. The
following sections show how to declare a custom tool and add it to
Kraken Server so it can be used in workflows. It is also presented how
to develop custom tools locally, under the desk.
