The Kraken
version [1.4](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.4)
introduces environment variables. This feature allows for defining
variables and their values associated with a branch. These variables
can then be used in a workflow schema using schema context and also in
shell commands as regular environment variables.

1.4 release brings several more features - check [the release
notes](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.4).

More details about environment variables can be found in the
documentation, specifically in the [Environment Variables section](/docs/env-vars).
