The latest release [0.753 release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.753)
brings support for webhooks for 2 new Git hosting services: [GitLab](https://gitlab.org)
and [Gitea](https://gitea.io/).

[Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide shows how to install Kraken CI.

[Webhooks Guide](/docs/guide-webhooks) shows how to use webhooks,
now in GitLab, Gitea and GitHub.

Webhooks allows for triggering a flow in a branch. The webhook may
come now from 3 Git hosting services: GitLab, Gitea and GitHub.  There
are two kinds of webhook events supported: push and pull request (in
the case of GitHub and Gitea) and merge request (in the case of
GitLab). A push even to a given branch causes a CI flow to be
started. If this is a pull request or a merge request, then a DEV flow
is started. If a workflow schema checks out sources from this
repository, a version indicated in the push or the pull/merge request is
checked out.

The [Webhook Guide](/docs/guide-webhooks) shows how to configure
webhooks in a project, and then how to configure a Git hosting
service. In the end, checking out the repository in the workflow
schema is presented.
