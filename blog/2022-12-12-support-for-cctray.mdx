[CCTray](https://cctray.org) is a protocol that allows users to fetch
the current state of a branch using [dedicated
clientes](https://cctray.org/clients/).

Kraken CI exposes a URL for a given branch that can be put to such a
client. This URL is available on a branch management page, in the
`Status Badge & CCTray` tab:

These feature landed in
[0.1097 version](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.1097)
and is documented in [notifications docs](/docs/notifications#cctray)
docs.
