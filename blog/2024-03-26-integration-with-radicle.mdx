The main feature introduced by Kraken version
[1.7](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.7) is
integration with [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz), a peer-to-peer code
collaboration stack.

Radilce leverages Gitâ€™s architecture combined with cryptography and a
gossip protocol to enable a fully sovereign developer network.  Unlike
centralized platforms like GitHub, there is no single entity
controlling the network or user data. Repositories are replicated
across peers in a decentralized manner. More details about Radicle can
be found it its [Guides](https://radicle.xyz/guides).

To arrange a CI process for Radicle there must be appointed Radicle server that will be used by Kraken CI server so:

- Kraken CI server can listen for webhooks coming from that Radicle server
- Kraken CI can provide links that lead to repositiories, commit
  changes, etc from Kraken CI web UI.

The configuration on Kraken CI side is described in [Webhooks guide](/docs/guide-webhooks).

<!--truncate-->

The details about setting up Radicle side are presented below. This
description is heavily based on the documentation [Radicle CI Integrations](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.gr/rad:z4Uh671FzoooaHjLvmtW9BtGMF9qm).

## Integrating a CI system using Radicle Webhooks

In order to add the desired webhook functionality, expected by Kraken
CI, there must be run the Radicle CI Broker alongside the Radicle
Node. Radicle CI Broker is responsible for grabbing any events that
the Radicle Node generates and for each event it invokes the Radicle
Webhooks Adapter that will invoke any registered outgoing webooks.

<Screen img="radicle-ci-arch.png" />

The second Radicle Node is required so that the first one can receive
any updates from the network and then generate events so the broker
will spawn any registered adapter.

> Making changes to a node wont generate any events to the same node.

### Radicle Setup

The setup requires a Radicle Node that will be running alongside the
Radicle CI Broker and the Radicle CI Broker that will invoke the
webhooks adapter.

Another Radicle Node is required with network access to the previous
one (through private, public IP - or even in the same host) that will
make changes to a repository. This way the first node will generate
events about the changes that the broker will grab and invoke the
webhook adapter.

#### Radicle Nodes

Radicle must be set up following one of the official installation
methodologies from: https://radicle.xyz/#get-started. After the Radicle
installation the `rad auth` command must be executed. More details
about `rad auth` can be found
[here](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5/tree/radicle-cli/examples/rad-auth.md).

After this you will be able to start your node by running
`rad node start`. At this point we all set!

You can run `radicle-httpd` and `rad web` so that you can access your
Radicle Node through the web interface. `radicle-httpd` provides an
HTTP API for managing the Radicle Node. `rad web` authenticates the
Radicle Node using the `radicle-httpd` towards
https://app.radicle.xyz/ so that users can manage their node through
the web client.

> Web client and API offers a subset of functionality compared to the rad cli.

You are able to setup and run more Radicle Nodes in the same host by
altering the Radicle's home path through the `RAD_HOME` environment
variable. So you can set up a new node using the
`RAD_HOME=~/.new_radicle rad auth`. For the rad web you can provide
the radicle-httpd URL to connect to `rad web https://app.radicle.xyz
--connect 127.0.0.1:8080`.

So in order to setup two nodes in our host we have to run:
```bash
# Primary Node
rad auth
rad node start
radicle-httpd
rad web  # optionally append with: https://app.radicle.xyz --connect 127.0.0.1:8080
```

For the second node use
```bash
# Secondary Node
RAD_HOME=~/.secondary_radicle rad auth
RAD_HOME=~/.secondary_radicle rad node start
```

#### Radicle Webhooks Adapter

As mentioned earlier, the Radicle CI Broker is responsible for
grabbing the Radicle Node events and then invoke any registered
adapter for any event. An adapter is responsible for conducting any
tasks.

In our case, the Radicle Webhooks Adapter is responsible for invoking
any registered webhooks when an event occurs.

> The Radicle Webhooks Adapter binary does not run as a stand alone
  application. Radicle CI broker is responsible for spawning it with
  the appropriate input data.

Radicle Webhooks Adapter read the webhook configuration from the
repository that the radicle node event occurred.


The Radicle Webhooks Adapter binary must have appropriate execute permissions.

The configuration that the adapter requires is:

| EnvVar                 | Description                                          | Default Value                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `WEBHOOKS_RETRIES`     | Total attempts until get a successful response.      | 3                                      |
| `WEBHOOKS_TIMOUT_SECS` | Timeout for webhook request.                         | 30                                     |
| `RAD_HTTPD_URL`        | URL of radicle's HTTPD.                              | "127.0.0.1:8080"                       |
| `RAD_BROWSE_URL`       | Public URL of a radicle seed to browse repositories. | "app.radicle.xyz/seeds/$RAD_HTTPD_URL" |
| `RAD_HOME`             | Path for radicle home directory.                     | "~/.radicle"                           |
| `RAD_PASSPHRASE`       | Passphrase for the radicle key.                      | ""                                     |
| `WEBHOOKS_DB_PATH`     | Path for the SQLite DB to store webhooks results.    | "./webhooks-adapter.sqlite"            |

More details about the radicle wbhooks adapter can be found at its
[repository](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/radicle.yorgos.net.gr/rad:z2hCUNw2T1qU31LyGy7VPEiS7BkxW).

#### Radicle CI Broker

The Radicle CI Broker is responsible for reading events from the
Radicle Node and invoke any registered adapter. Radicle CI Broker must
be initiated and run at the background at all times in order to grab
and process any new event from the Radicle Node. In our setup we
should connect Radicle CI Broker to our primary node ie. #1.

The configuration of the broker should be stored in a .yaml file as follows:

```yaml
$ cat ci-broker-cfg.yaml
default_adapter: webhooks
adapters:
  webhooks:
    command: radicle-webhooks-adapter
    env:
filters:
```

`radicle-webhooks-adapter` should be replaced with the full path of
the Radicle webhooks adapter binary path.

Then the broker can be initiated through the command:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./ci-broker ci-broker-cfg.yaml
```

`ci-broker-cfg.yaml` is the path of the yaml file that contains the broker's configuration.

More details about the Radicle CI Broker can be found at its
[repository](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/radicle.liw.fi/rad:zwTxygwuz5LDGBq255RA2CbNGrz8).


### Repository Setup

Now that Radicle Primary Node with CI Broker is in place we have to
properly setup our repository. We can choose to set it up to any of
the available Radicle Nodes but we should seed it through the node
that runs the broker.

Now it's time to initialize a Git repository. This will be done in our
secondary node ie. #2. We do it as a normal Git repository through `git init`
and then we should initialize it as a rad repository through
`RAD_HOME=~/.secondary_radicle rad init`.

For more details about how to initialize a repository you can check
this [example](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/seed.radicle.xyz/rad:z3gqcJUoA1n9HaHKufZs5FCSGazv5/tree/radicle-cli/examples/rad-init.md).

Repository should contain the configuration for the webhooks. This
file should be stored under the `.radicle/webhooks/` directory in our
repo. Each configuration file should be a `.yaml` (or `.yml`) that
will contain all the details for each webhook. The schema of the
file's content is like this:

```yaml
outgoing_webhook_kraken_ci:
    payload_url: https://kraken-server/webhooks/25/radicle
    content_type: application/json
    shared_secret: <some-secret>
```

* `outgoing_webhook_kraken_ci` is the friendly name of the webhook;
* `payload_url` is the URL that will be invoked when an event occurs,
   e.g. `https://kraken-server/webhooks/25/radicle` where `kraken-server`
   should be replaced with real Kraken CI Server address and 25 with
   appropriate project ID in Kraken CI;
* `content_type` is the content type of the payload (currently only
  `application/json` is supported);
* `shared_secret` should be a high entropy secret key used to generate
  the SHA-256 hash signature using HMAC hex digest from the provided
  webhook's secret token alongside each payload. This result will be
  within the headers of the webhook request so that the recipient will
  be able to validate the request.

Multiple webhook configuration files are supported within the
repository using multiple files or separating the entries using the
three dashes `---`.  As a user stores all the webhooks' details within
the repository these details must be somehow hidden to the rest of the
users. So, these configuration files should be encrypted in order to
ensure that the configuration data are not exposed.

In order to encrypt these files we should use the [age file encryption
tool](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). This tool permits the
encryption of a file using multiple public keys and the decryption of
each file using just one of the private keys. After the age tool is
installed you can encrypt each file using the following command:

```shell
age -encrypt -R radicle1.pub -R radicle2.pub -R radicle3.pub -o destination_for_encrupted_file.yaml file_to_encrypt
```

The `-R radicleX.pub` is added for every public key we want to encrypt
the file with. It is completely fine to use one or more keys. The keys
that should e used are the radicle public/private keys located at
`$RAD_HOME/keys/` directory. We should encrypt the webhooks settings
using the keys of the users that we permit to be able to view and
propose changes to these settings. We should definitely use the key
that the webhooks adapter will use in order to decrypt the webhooks'
settings files. This key is located under the $RAD_HOME and it's
passphrase should be at $RAD_PASSPHRASE.

The `destination_for_encrupted_file.yaml` is the file that should be
committed to the repo. It's critical here to use the public key of the
radicle node where the Radicle CI Broker runs in order to allow the
adapter to decrypt it later.

For more details and examples for this process you can refer to the
[radicle-webhooks-adapter documentation](https://app.radicle.xyz/nodes/radicle.yorgos.net.gr/rad:z2hCUNw2T1qU31LyGy7VPEiS7BkxW/tree/docs/webhook_settings_persistence.md).

> For this setup there is no reason to follow the steps under the
  `Automated encryption & decryption` section but feel free to do so!

Now that we have our repository ready we have to ensure that the
radicle node that runs alongside the broker (the primary node) is
seeding the repository. Seeding a repository means that the Radicle
node will seed that repo in the Radicle p2p network (as we seed in
torrents).  This can be done either by cloning the repo through the
`rad clode RAD_ID` command or the `rad seed RAD_ID` command at the
primary node (where the broker runs). `RAD_ID` is the repo's radicle
ID. This can be retrieved through the `rad ls` command or by running
the `rad .` command within the repository's folder.

> By seeding a repository we ensure that the a node receives any
  events for the specific repo.

### Testing

We can now check our setup if everything works fine. On the Host #1 we
should start the Radicle Node and the CI Broker. The broker will report
some logs:


```
 Running `./ci-broker webhooks`
 INFO  ci_broker > Radicle CI broker starts
 DEBUG ci_broker > loaded configuration: Config {
    default_adapter: "webhooks",
    adapters: {
        "webhooks": Adapter {
            command: "/tmp/bin/radicle-webhooks-adapter",
            env: {},
        },
    },
    filters: [],
}
 INFO  radicle_ci_broker::event > subscribing to local node events
```

> You can use a webhook listener service (such as the
  https://webhook.site/) in order to register the provided URL and
  check the requested payload alongside any headers.

#### Push

From the secondary node we should push some changes to the
repo. Pushing will automatically sync with other nodes and will print
something like in the broker's log output:

```
$ git push
âœ“ Patch b1d3420 updated to 54884569f96ac1db8ea1fb19004a536bb6e0ab83
âœ“ Synced with 2 node(s)
To rad://z32iyJDyFLqvPFzwHm8YadK4HQ2EY/z6MksMpnzPF48pk4XAnqVotKmfs2SE3bxA57UA8KL9DnWnY3
   a680e4d..6a76ee5  ha -> patches/b1d3420337dc4817cb9f2c2a0320e60b11530a25
```

If the sync fails we can retry it through the
`RAD_HOME=~/.secondary_radicle rad sync` command. A successful sync
will generate some events to the broker.

If the webhook configuration is properly set up we can see in the logs
the webhook URL printed out. We can see that we will receive two
events from the broker which will make our broker invoke the webhooks
for these two events. One event will be about the update of the
`sigrefs` and the other one is for the actual push event on the repo.

And then in Kraken CI side we should see a triggered flow in a project
associated with the repositored hosted in Radicle. On the flow page,
in `Repo Changes`, there are information retrieved from Radicle Push
event. We can visit hosted Git repo in Radicle or visit the change commits.
