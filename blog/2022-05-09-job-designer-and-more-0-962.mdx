The job designer
([#171](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues/171)) is the main
feature in
[0.962](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.962)
release.

Besides that, it contains:

- support for multiline shell scripts and selecting shell executable
  ([#183](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues/183) and
  [#184](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues/184)) charts
- new chart showing flows duration in a branch ([#173](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues/173))
- multiple new base docker images for various programming languages
- split results chart to pass ratio chart and passed/total chart ([#187](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues/183))


More information about these changes is below.

### Job Designer

Now it is possible to design job steps using a UI available on a
branch management page.

<Screen img="screen-branch-prepare-step-button.png" />

The `Prepare Step` button shows the job designer dialog.

<Screen img="screen-branch-prepare-step-dialog.png" />

The dialog shows all available fields of a step with descriptions and
input boxes pre-filled with default values. These fields are available
for a tool selected in the dropdown at the top of the dialog. Below,
there is the step generated in JSON format.

In the case of the picture above, there is a shell tool
selected. There are multiple fields available. A few are used:
`cmd`, `cwd` and `shell_exec`. The generated step in JSON contains
these fields with user-provided values.

Now a user may copy the generated step and then paste it into the stage
schema code.


### Shell Tool Improvements

The shell tool got two improvements. One allows for entering a multiline
script instead of just one command. The other one allows for indicating
an alternative shell executable - the default one is `/bin/sh`.

A multiline script can be provided in the following way:

```json
{
   "steps": [{
       "tool": "shell",
       "script": """
           echo 'multiline script'
           ls -al
           echo 'completed'
       """
   }]
}
```

Changing default shell executable to e.g. `zsh` goes this way:

```json
{
   "steps": [{
       "tool": "shell",
       "cmd": "echo $ZSH_VERSION",
       "shell_exec": "zsh"
   }]
}
```

More in the [docs](/docs/schema#shell).


### Flow Duration on Branch Chart

On the branch management page, on `Stats and Charts` tab, there are
basic stats about the branch, like the total number of flows or the
average flow duration in the last week. Below these stats, a chart
shows the duration of flows over time.

The whole stats and charts are presented in two instances: one for CI
and the other one for DEV flows.


### New Base Docker Images

There are multiple new Docker images prepared to be used in Kraken CI.
The full list is available in the [docs page](/docs/docker-executor#language-images).


### Split Results Chart

Initially, the pass ratio was shown together with total and passed
counts on the same chart. Now that is split into two charts: 1) pass
ratio chart and 2) total and passed counts.
