The dark mode is the main feature in [0.945](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.945) release.

Besides that, it contains:

- added a new tool `values_collect` that allows collecting values and then doing charts in UI based on them
- added cleaning cache in MinIO
- updated Go base image
- added new base image for [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)

More information about these changes is below.

### Dark Mode

Now it is possible to look at Kraken CI web UI at night using dark mode.

If the dark mode is switched on in the browser that it will be
automatically activated in Kraken CI web UI. Otherwise, it is
possible to manually switch the dark mode on or off using the profile
drop-down button in the top left corner of the screen (see below).

### New Tool values_collect

When testing is being carried out by a Kraken agent, custom measured
metrics can be returned besides test results. Now it is possible to
just generate such measurements, store them in a JSON file and then
load them to the Kraken server. Then they will be visible on a job
results page and it is possible to display a chart based on these
values.

The reported file should look like this (e.g. metrics.json):

```json
{
    "metric-1": 432,
    "metric-2": 2.12,
}
```

The step that consumes these values should look like this:

```json
{
    "tool": "values_collect",
    "files": [{
        "name": "metrics.json",
        "namespace": "metrics"
    }, {
        "name": "params.json",
        "namespace": "params"
    }],
    "cwd": "example"
}
```

The end results looks like that:

The whole example of workflow with collected results is present in
Kraken lab: https://lab.kraken.ci/branches/32/ci. Check the steps
definitions in [branch management
page](https://lab.kraken.ci/branches/32) and then check the charts on
[tests results page](https://lab.kraken.ci/test_case_results/595950),
in the charts tab.


### Cleaning Cache in MinIO

The files that are always pulled to a build environmnt can be cached
between builds, so they don't have to be downloaded from the internet
each time. More about caching
[here](http://localhost:3000/docs/schema/#cache).

The Current release introduces a feature that automatically removes
old cached files. Now, after 10 days, these files are deleted from
MinIO.


### Changes in Base Images

The Go lang base image has been updated. The latest image contains Go
in 1.18.  The location of the image is:
[krakenci/golang:1.18](https://hub.docker.com/r/krakenci/golang).

There is also a new image with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/). It is
available under:
[krakenci/mlflow](https://hub.docker.com/r/krakenci/mlflow).
