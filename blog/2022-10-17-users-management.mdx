Users management is a basic functionality that allows for adding users
and assigning roles to them. This translates to users authatication
and authorization. In case of Kraken CI, this is described on [users
docs](/docs/users) pages. This feature landed in [0.1037
version](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.1037).
