There have been added three articles in the Kraken's documentation
about integration of testing frameworks with Kraken CI:

- [JUnit](/docs/tf-junit)
- [Pytest](/docs/tf-pytest)
- [RobotFramework](/docs/tf-robotframework)

The latest release [0.698
release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.698)
brings also a new feature: collecting, storing and presenting custom
generated reports in e.g. HTML.

[Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide shows how to install Kraken CI.

### Testing Frameworks

The articles about testing frameworks shows how to use well known
frameworks like [JUnit](/docs/tf-junit), [Pytest](/docs/tf-pytest) and
[RobotFramework](/docs/tf-robotframework) inside Kraken CI. There are
presented stage workflow schemas with steps that:

1. execute the tests using particular framework
1. report results to Kraken server
1. store generated custom reports on Kraken server

### Custom Reports

The latest release [0.698
release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.698)
allows now for storing and presenting custom reports in e.g. HTML format.
The are available along current generic test case results page.

More details about step for storing reports can be found in [the
docs](/docs/schema#artifacts) and example usage on [RobotFramework
example](/docs/tf-robotframework).
