## Improved diagnostics

### Logs

The diagnostics page accessible from the top menu bar got a
new feature: browser of Kraken services logs. The second tab on the
diagnostics page, called `Logs`, now contains filters and a
logs window.

The list of select buttons at the top allows selecting Kraken services
like server/api, celery or watchdog. Below, there is a dropbox with
log level selection, from info level to error level. When the celery
service is selected, selecting task type from the dropbox list is also
possible.

### Error Indicator

To make it easier to reach logs with some problems, there have been
added an error indicator in the top menu bar.

<Screen img="screen-error-indicator.png" />

It is visible on all Kraken pages. If it is greater than 0, it is
displayed in reddish color to get user attention. The count indicates
the number of errors in Kraken services logs in the last hour.
When clicked, it leads to the logs page.

## Preliminary AWS EC2 integration

The second, quite exciting feature, is integration with AWS EC2. The
integration allows for autoscaling Kraken's agents. If no jobs are
waiting for execution, then there are no waitng agents on EC2
VMs. When they appear, new VMs in EC2 are spawned immediately. If the
number of jobs grows, the number of VMs can grow as well. There is
possible to set a limit for the number of VMs. VMs can be reused or
reclaimed after a given period of idle time or after an indicated
number of executed jobs.

The configuration in Kraken for AWS EC2 integration is 1) in global
settings (credentials) and 2) on the agent's group page.

More details will be presented when the feature is completed.
