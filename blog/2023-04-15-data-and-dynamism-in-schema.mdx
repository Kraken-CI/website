The Kraken version [1.1](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.1)
introduces even more improvements in logging.

The major changes are:

- added storing user data server-side
- data of internal objects and user data are now exposed in a schema code
- added support for several new operating systems

1.1 release brings several more features - check [the release
notes](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.1).

More details about the major features are below.

### User Data

This feature enables users to store data in the workflow schema code
on the server-side. For instance, a user can prepare data in JSON
format in one step of the schema code. Then, in the subsequent step,
the user can upload the data from the prepared file to the Kraken Server. The
data can be attached to a flow, branch, or project. If it is attached
to a flow, its scope is restricted to that particular flow, and it can
be used in the next stage of that flow. However, it will not be
visible in a new flow. If the data is attached to a branch or project,
it will be shared by subsequent flows.

Details and examples are described in the
[Data Tool section of the Workflow Schema documentation](/docs/schema#data).

### Data in Schema Code

The data stored by the user, as well as the data of other internal
objects such as jobs, runs, flows, branches, and projects, can be
accessed in a stage schema code.

The data can be accessed via a context that is passed to the stage
function and also through string interpolation of special variables.

All of this allows for significant dynamism in a stage schema
code. For example, the list of jobs or step details may be based on
the data stored by a user in previous stages.

Details are described in the [Data in Schema](/docs/schema-data)
chapter in the docs.

### New OSes Supported

The new supported OSes include Rocky Linux 9, AlmaLinux and Debian
Bookworm. The full list is availabled in
[Docker Executor](/docs/docker-executor#tested-vanilla-images)
docs.
