This time not about autoscaling or other cloud feature. This time we
are coming back to the core area of Kraken: testing. Today's [0.854
release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.854)
introduces test results commenting.

More information about commenting is below.

<!--truncate-->

[Test results comments](/docs/test-results-basics#comments) feature allows
for adding sticky comments to test case results. When you spot a new
failure, you may add a comment stating, e.g. the reason for the failure
or link to a bug in a bug tracker. If the failure persists in the
subsequent test runs, the added comment is still presented next to
the new result. If new facts about the failure are revealed, you may
extend the comment.

There is also a state of the comment. More information about these
details can be found in the [docs page](/docs/test-results-basics#comments)
of the results comments feature.
