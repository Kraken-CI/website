The main feature introduced by Kraken version
[1.7](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.7) is
integration with [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz), a peer-to-peer code
collaboration stack. The second one is notifications to Discord channels.

To see the release details, please check the [the release notes](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.7).

More details about Radicle integration and Discord notifications are provided below ([Read More](/blog/radicle-and-discord)).

#### Radicle

Radilce leverages Gitâ€™s architecture combined with cryptography and a
gossip protocol to enable a fully sovereign developer network.  Unlike
centralized platforms like GitHub, there is no single entity
controlling the network or user data. Repositories are replicated
across peers in a decentralized manner.

Radicle is reaching its maturity - the 1.0 version is going to be released in a few weeks.

Kraken CI now includes support to communicate with Radicle,
enabling it to receive push events generated by a Radicle Node. These
events trigger a build flow within Kraken CI.

The full guide about setting up integration of Kraken CI with Radicle
can be found in the blog post [Integration with Radicle](/blog/integration-with-radicle).

#### Discord

Another significat feature that has been added to this Kraken's
release is notifications to Discord channels. Now the result of an
executed run can be posted to indicated Discord channel. More details
can be found in [the notification docs](/docs/schema#discord).


That's all. To get started, simply install or upgrade to the
[1.7 version](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.7) and
experience all the benefits firsthand. If you have any questions or
need assistance, submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/issues)
or ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jUvSZ4S5m3).
