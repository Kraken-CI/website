The last week brings to Kraken's source code many quality
improvements. Services like
[LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Kraken-CI/kraken/) and
[Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Kraken-CI/kraken/dashboard) help
fixing code smells but also serious problems. So during that week in
Kraken's repository, many commits have landed that refactor the
code, fix issues and do code cleanup.

Thanks to all these changes, the project earned these quality badges:
