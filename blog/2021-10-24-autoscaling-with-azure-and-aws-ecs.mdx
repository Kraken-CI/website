The latest release [0.748 release](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.748)
brings a new public cloud in autoscaling features: Azure and AWS ECS.

[Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide shows how to install Kraken CI.

[Autoscaling Guide](/docs/guide-autoscale) shows how to use
autoscaling with Azure VMs and AWS ECS.

Maintaining a fixed number of machines for Kraken CI can be costly. If
there is no high traffic of builds, then some machines sit idle and
waste power. The solution to this problem is autoscaling ie. spawning
machines with Kraken Agents dynamically depending on the current needs
in the Kraken CI. If there is submitted a new flow with many building
or testing jobs, then new machines are spawned. When the flow
completes, machines are terminated and no costs are incurred.

The [Autoscaling Guide](/docs/guide-autoscale) shows how to configure
access to Azure, then how to configure parameters and behaviour of
spawned machines. In the end, the usage in job definitions is
presented.
