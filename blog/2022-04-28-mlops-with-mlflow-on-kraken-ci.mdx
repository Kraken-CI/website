Besides building, testing and deploying, Kraken CI is also a pretty
nice tool to build an [MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps)
pipeline. In this article, it will be shown how to leverage Kraken CI to
build a CI workflow for machine learning using
[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

### MLOps and MLflow

MLOps is a set of practices that aims to build and maintain machine
learning models in production reliably and efficiently. One of
prominent tools in this area is [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine
learning lifecycle. It tackles four primary functions:

- Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results
  (MLflow Tracking).
- Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form to share
  with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow
  Projects).
- Managing and deploying models from various ML libraries to a
  variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models).
- Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the entire
  lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage
  transitions, and annotations (MLflow Model Registry).

### MLflow in Kraken CI

In the following sections, I will describe how to prepare a workflow
in Kraken CI to train an ML model. This is an LSTM model that will
predict stock prices based on historical data.

The workflow will be:

1. pulling live stock data and preparing it for training ([source
1](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example/blob/master/download_raw_data.py),
[source
2](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example/blob/master/transform_data.py))

2. performing the training ([source 3](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example/blob/master/train_model.py))

3. storing model metrics in Kraken CI for charting

The MLflow project is described in [MLproject](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example/blob/master/MLproject).

### Workflow Definition

The whole Kraken CI workload is defined [here](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example/blob/master/.kraken/one.py).

There are 3 steps:

```json
   "steps": [{
       "tool": "git",
       "checkout": "https://github.com/Kraken-CI/mlflow-example.git"
   }, {
       "tool": "shell",
       "cmd": "/opt/conda/bin/mlflow run .",
       "cwd": "mlflow-example",
       "timeout": 1200
   }, {
       "tool": "values_collect",
       "files": [{
           "name": "metrics.json",
           "namespace": "metrics"
       }, {
           "name": "params.json",
           "namespace": "params"
       }],
       "cwd": "mlflow-example"
   }],
```

1. Checkout mflow example project sources

2. Run the mlflow project ie. download data, prepare it, run a
training and at the end store metrics about the trained model to
metrics.json

3. Upload collected metrics together with hyperparameters from
params.json to Kraken server

The last step allows for charting accuracy and RMS of the model over
builds.

There is one more element defined in the workflow: the definition of
execution environment:

```json
   "environments": [{
       "system": "krakenci/mlflow",
       "executor": "docker",
       "agents_group": "all",
       "config": "default"
   }]
```
Here we can notice the use of a pre-prepared image with mlflow.
It is available in Docker hub:
[krakenci/mlflow](https://hub.docker.com/r/krakenci/mlflow).

The whole example of workflow is present in Kraken lab:
https://lab.kraken.ci/branches/32/ci. Check the steps definitions in
[branch management page](https://lab.kraken.ci/branches/32).

### Execution and Monitoring

Besides the workflow definition, Kraken UI also shows collected data
and the charts drawn from this data:
https://lab.kraken.ci/test_case_results/595950, the charts tab.

The right chart shows value of `loss` collected over time:

### Summary

This article shows how Kraken CI can be used to build an MLOps
pipeline.  The pipeline downloads raw data, prepares the data for
training and then executes the training. The trained model
metrics are collected and charted in Kraken UI at the end.
