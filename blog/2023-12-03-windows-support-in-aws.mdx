Kraken Agent on AWS EC2. This means that it is now possible to execute
jobs on Windows systems in the AWS EC2 environment.

The 1.6 release brings several more changes and fixes. To see the details,
please check the [the release notes](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.6).
Some of the changes included are:

There are a few requirements for an AWS AMI Windows image to make it
work with Kraken CI. It should have preinstalled Python and Git. The
generated image should also have the ability to run a `user data`
script on the first boot. This script is used to install the Kraken
Agent and your own init script (which can be passed via Kraken).

Here, you can find an example script for Ansible that prepares an AWS
AMI image for Windows with all the dependencies included:

The full guide about setting up Kraken execution agents in AWS EC2 can
be found in [Autoscale in Cloud docs](/docs/autoscale-in-cloud).

That's all. To get started, simply install or upgrade to the
[1.6 version](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v1.6) and
experience all the benefits firsthand. If you have any questions or
