Till now, Kraken CI relied on pretty old versions
of [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
and [MinIO](https://min.io/). In the latest Kraken CI release, both
have been upgraded.

Clickhouse has been upgraded from `20.11.4.13` to `22.10.2.11`. The
migration is seamless from the Kraken CI point of view. There is no need
for explicit data migration.

MinIO has been upgraded from `RELEASE.2020-12-18T03-27-42Z` to
`RELEASE.2022-10-24T18-35-07Z`. The major visible change is the names
of environment variables that hold credentials. Previously they were
`MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`, now they are
`MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, respectively. Values of
these variables may stay the same; they do not need to be changed.

These changes landed in
[0.1091 version](https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases/tag/v0.1091).
