Kraken CI has user authentication and authorizations. Before a user
starts using the system, he/she must log in to the system. Still, a
user does not have access to all resources. Access is limited by
roles that are assigned to a user.

## Managing Users

Managing users is only available to `admin` user and users with
`superadmin` role.  The user management page can be accessed via the
`Configuration` menu at the top right, then `Users` position and
again `Users` menu item.

Clicking it leads to the users management page.

On the left is an `Add User` button and a table with users.

Selecting a user in this table shows its details in the right panel.
This user panel allows for changing a user password, disabling a user,
assigning `superadmin` role and assigning one of the three predefined
roles in a selected project.


## Adding a User

Clicking the `Add User` button opens a dialog that allows for entering a
user name and a password.

When adding is accepted by the `Add User` button in the dialog box,
then it is shown in the users table. Selecting the user shows its
details in the user panel on the right side.

## Basic User Options

In the user panel, it is possible to change a user password by clicking
`Change Password` button.

It is also possible to disable a user account. A disabled user cannot
login into the system and cannot do any operation if it is already
logged in to the system.


## User Roles

There are two kinds of roles:

- global role `superadmin`
- three predefined roles per project: `Viewer`, `Power User` and `Admin`

`superadmin` role allows for all available operations in the system.

The per-project roles give some rights only to a given project. The
rights are grnted by the roles:

- `Viewer` - allows for viewing data only: browsing branches, their
  flows, results, etc.
- `Power User` - extends `Viewer` role by allowing for triggering
  actions like: run a flow, rerun a job, define new stage, etc.
- `Admin` - extends `Power User` role by allowing for e.g. deleting a
  branch or a project, managing project secrets.

The selected user may be assigned to a given project with a given
role. Later this role can be changed by clicking a role for a given
project. At the end, it is possible to remove a user from a particular
project.
