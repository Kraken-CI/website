Kraken CI has user authentication and authorizations. Before a user
starts using the system, he/she must log in to the system. Still, a
user does not have access to all resources. Access is limited by
roles that are assigned to a user.

## Managing Users

Managing users is only available to `admin` user and users with
`superadmin` role.  The user management page can be accessed via the
`Configuration` menu at the top right, then `Users` position and
again `Users` menu item.

Clicking it leads to the users management page.

<Screen img="screen-users.png" />

On the left is an `Add User` button and a table with users.

Selecting a user in this table shows its details in the right panel.
This user panel allows for changing a user password, disabling a user,
assigning `superadmin` role and assigning one of the three predefined
roles in a selected project.


## Adding a User

Clicking the `Add User` button opens a dialog that allows for entering a
user name and a password.

When adding is accepted by the `Add User` button in the dialog box,
then it is shown in the users table. Selecting the user shows its
details in the user panel on the right side.

## Basic User Options

In the user panel, it is possible to change a user password by clicking
`Change Password` button.

It is also possible to disable a user account. A disabled user cannot
login into the system and cannot do any operation if it is already
logged in to the system.


## User Roles

There are two kinds of roles:

- global role `superadmin`
- three predefined roles per project: `Viewer`, `Power User` and `Admin`

`superadmin` role allows for all available operations in the system.

The per-project roles give some rights only to a given project. The
rights are grnted by the roles:

- `Viewer` - allows for viewing data only: browsing branches, their
  flows, results, etc.
- `Power User` - extends `Viewer` role by allowing for triggering
  actions like: run a flow, rerun a job, define new stage, etc.
- `Admin` - extends `Power User` role by allowing for e.g. deleting a
  branch or a project, managing project secrets.

The selected user may be assigned to a given project with a given
role. Later this role can be changed by clicking a role for a given
project. At the end, it is possible to remove a user from a particular
project.

## Identity Providers

By default, user authentication is happening locally in the Kraken
server. Still, it is possible to provide an external source of users and
means for authentication by so-called Identity Providers. This also allows
setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) scheme ie. users may sign in once
in a central authentication system and then use it for authentication in
other systems and services.

To set this up, go to the `Configuration` menu at the top right, then
`Users` position and `Identity Providers` menu item.

<Screen img="screen-idp-menu.png" />

This leads to the Settings web page with the `Identity Providers` tab.

On this tab, there are 2 sections available:

1. LDAP
2. OpenID Connect / OAuth 2

### LDAP

The source of users' identity is an LDAP server, which is used for
users' authenticating. The login page is the same for local users in
Kraken Web UI. Kraken Server authenticates users using credentials
provided by them on this login page. Kraken Server connects to LDAP
Server and checks if a user is present in LDAP server and his/her
password is correct.

To perform this operation, Kraken Server needs a few settings that will
allow Kraken Server to talk to LDAP Server. These settings need to be
provided in the following form:

<Screen img="screen-idp-ldap.png" />

`Server Address` is an apparent field. `Bind DN` (Distinguished Name)
and `Bind Password` are used to authenticate Kraken Server to LDAP
Server. They are needed to connect to LDAP Server. `Base DN` is a
subtree in LDAP tree where users are looked for. `User Search
Filter` is an LDAP query expression used to look for users in
`Base DN` subtree. In `%s` placeholder is inserted a user's username
that is provided by a user on the login page.

After saving the settings using the `Save Settings` button on the
bottom of the page, it is possible to check if configured parameters
are correct and if they allow to establish a connection to LDAP
Server. For that purpose, the `Test LDAP Connection` button should be
used.

### OpenID Connect and OAuth

In the case of OpenID Connect and OAuth, the source of users' identity
is OAuth Authorization Server. In this case, Kraken Web UI redirects
to an external login page hosted on Authorization Server. A user
enters his/her credentials to this server and then this server
redirects the browser back to Kraken Web UI, providing a user
token. Kraken Server is validating this token against the
Authorization Server to confirm that this is a valid user. If all is
ok, a user is allowed by Kraken Server to enter Kraken Web UI.

To perform this operation, Kraken Server needs a few settings that will
allow Kraken Server to talk to OAuth Authorization Server. Kraken
supports several providers of OAuth Authorization Servers. They are
Google, Microsoft, GitHub and Auth0. The settings for these providers
may be provided in the following forms:

<Screen img="screen-idp-google-ms.png" />

<Screen img="screen-idp-github-auth0.png" />

In each case, `Client ID` and `Client Secret` are needed. In the
case of Auth0, the `OpenID Config URL` is also required, which is
specific per organization.
