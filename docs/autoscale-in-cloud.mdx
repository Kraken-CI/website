Kraken CI allows for creating executing machines dynamically in the
cloud when they are needed. They can be either virtual machines or
containers. When new jobs are triggered and there are no agents
available for them, new machines with Kraken agents are
spawned. The configuration of the way of spawning new machines is
located in agent groups.

Currently, Kraken CI autoscaling is supporting:

- AWS EC2 virtual machines
- AWS ECS containers
- Azure virtual machines
- Kubernetes


## Preparing Cloud Environment

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="aws-ec2" label="AWS EC2" default>

In the case of AWS EC2, it is required to assign proper permissions to the
accessing user so that Kraken can create or destroy EC2
instances. The list of all requires permissions looks as follows:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
                "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteKeyPair",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus"
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="aws-ecs" label="AWS ECS">

In the case of AWS ECS, it is required to assign proper permissions to
the accessing user so that Kraken can create or destroy ECS
tasks. The list of all requires permissions looks as follows:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
                "ecs:RunTask",
                "ecs:StopTask",
                "ecs:DescribeTasks",

        }
    ]
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

For Kubernetes, there are two accessing variants: Kraken CI is
installed inside Kubernetes cluster or outside. In both cases, a proper
access must be configured. When Kraken is installed inside a
Kubernetes cluster then this is made using Helm chart and it also sets
service account and proper permissions. When Kraken CI sits outside of
Kubernetes cluster, then the service account and permissions must be
configured in the following way.

The content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <namespace>

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kraken
  namespace: <namespace>

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole

metadata:
  name: kraken-role

rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["nodes", "services", "pods", "endpoints", "namespaces"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete"]

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding

metadata:
  name: kraken-crb

roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kraken-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: kraken
    namespace: <namespace>
```

should be copied and pasted to `kraken-serviceaccount.yaml` file or
downloaded from [here](/kraken-serviceaccount.yaml). Before creating
the resources, set your namespace by replacing all occurrences of
`<namespace>` with e.g. `kraken`.

And then create these resources using `kubectl`:

```console
kubectl apply -f kraken-serviceaccount.yaml
```

This will create:

  - an indicated namespace (e.g. `kraken`),
  - a service account `kraken`,
  - a cluster role `kraken-role` that allows browsing nodes, services,
    pods, endpoints and namespaces, and creating and deleting pods,
  - cluster role binding `kraken-crb` that assigns `kraken-role` role to `kraken`
    service account

Service account's token will be used in the next steps.

## Global Cloud Settings

First, global settings must be set to allow access to a given cloud
provider. In Web UI, on Kraken -> Settings page, in Cloud tab,
there is a form for collecting credentials to cloud providers:

<Screen img="screen-settings-cloud.png" />

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="aws" label="AWS" default>

In the case of AWS, `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` are required.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="azure" label="Azure">

When Microsoft Azure is used, then there are required `Subscription ID`,
`Tenant ID`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

When Kraken is installed inside Kubernetes cluster, then only setting
`Namespace` field is required, `API Server URL` must be empty.

When Kraken is running outside of Kubernetes cluster then all fields
are required: `API Server URL`, `Namespace` and `Token`. `Namespace`
and `Token` were created in previous steps. The following commands will
reveal the token.

First, check the definition of `kraken` service account:

```console
kubectl get serviceaccounts/kraken -n <namespace> -o yaml
```

This should display a list of secrets at the bottom. The token should
be stored in a secret with a name in the form `kraken-token-XXXXX`
like e.g. `kraken-token-5fvcb`.

Now retrieve the token value:

```console
kubectl get secret kraken-token-XXXXX -n <namespace> -o yaml
```

The value should be under the token field, and it should be pretty
long. It is encoded using base64, and in this form, it should be copied
& pasted to Kraken CI cloud settings (no decoding is required).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Configuration in Agents Groups

Having set credentials to cloud providers, it is possible now to
configure the aspects of spawning new machines. This can be done on Kraken
-> Agents -> Groups page.  When a particular group is selected, then
its details will be presented on a separate tab. On this tab, there is
a section `Agents Deployment`. So the deployment can be manual
(default) or automated to the particular cloud provider.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="aws-ec2" label="AWS EC2" default>

In the case of `AWS EC2`, jobs are executed in AWS EC2 VMs. There are
the following options that can be set:

<Screen img="screen-agents-groups-cloud-aws.png" />

The meaning of the settings is as follows.

In **General** section:

**Region** - AWS region where a machine will be spawned

**Instances Limit** - maximum number of spawned machines at a time

**Default AMI Image** - if AMI image is not provided in job definition
  then this one is used

In **VM Options** section:

**Instance Type** - EC2 instance type that should be used for spawned
  machines, the full list is available on [AWS web
  page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

**Spot Instance** - indicates where Spot instance should be used ([AWS
  docs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/))

**Monitoring** - indicates if monitoring should be enabled ([AWS
  docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html))

**CPU Credits Unlimited** - this allows having more burst power, more
  in [AWS
  docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.html)

**Disk Size** - the size of root disk, if 0 then default size is used otherwise provided number is counted in GB

**Init Script** - a value of this text is passed as UserData to EC2
  instance, generally, this is a script that is executing during the
  first boot of instance ([AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html))

In **Destruction** section:

**Destroy VM after N jobs** - this indicates that the machine should
  be destroyed (terminated) after it is used in N Kraken jobs, default
  is 1, ie. machine is used once and then it is destroyed so each time
  a new fresh machine is used for each job; 0 means that this
  mechanism is disabled

**Destroy VM after N minutes of idle time** - this indicates that the
  machine should be destroyed (terminated) after it is not used in any
  Kraken jobs for a given number of minutes, default is 10 minutes,
  ie. a machine is destroyed if it sits idle for 10 minutes; 0 means
  that this mechanism is disabled

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="aws-ecs" label="AWS ECS">

In the case of `AWS ECS`, jobs are executed in containers in AWS ECS
cluster. There are the following options that can be set:

The meaning of the settings is as follows.

In **General** section:

**Location** - Azure location (region) where a machine will be spawned

**Instances Limit** - maximum number of spawned machines at a time

**Default Image** - if image is not provided in job definition
  then this one is used; the expected format is: publisher:offer:sku:version,
  e.g.: Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal:20_04-lts:20.04.202109080

In **VM Options** section:

**VM Size** - Azure VM size that should be used for spawned
  machines; more about VM sizes can be found on [Azure web
  page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes)

**Init Script** - a value of this text is passed as user_data to VM
  instance, generally, this is a script that is executing during the
  first boot of instance

In **Destruction** section:

**Destroy VM after N jobs** - this indicates that the machine should
  be destroyed (terminated) after it is used in N Kraken jobs, default
  is 1, ie. machine is used once and then it is destroyed so each time
  a new fresh machine is used for each job; 0 means that this
  mechanism is disabled

**Destroy VM after N minutes of idle time** - this indicates that the
  machine should be destroyed (terminated) after it is not used in any
  Kraken jobs for a given number of minutes, default is 10 minutes,
  ie. a machine is destroyed if it sits idle for 10 minutes; 0 means
  that this mechanism is disabled

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="kubernetes" label="Kubernetes">

In the case of `Kubernetes`, jobs are executed in containers in a
Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes cluster can be self-hosted or hosted in
a public cloud like AWS EKS. There are the following options that can
be set:

<Screen img="screen-agents-groups-cloud-kubernetes.png" />

The meaning of the settings is as follows.

In **General** section:

**Instances Limit** - maximum number of spawned containers at a time

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Usage

Now when a job is assigned to an agents group with configured Agents
Deployment then a new machine will be spawned for that job if there
are no available agents.
