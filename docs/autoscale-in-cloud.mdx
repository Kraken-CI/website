Kraken CI allows for creating executing machines dynamically in the
cloud when they are needed. They can be either virtual machines or
containers. When new jobs are triggered and there are no agents
available for them, new machines with Kraken agents are
spawned. The configuration of the way of spawning new machines is
located in agent groups.

Currently, Kraken CI autoscaling is supporting:

- AWS EC2 virtual machines


## Global Cloud Settings

First, global settings have to be set to allow access to a given cloud
provider. In Web UI, on Kraken -> Settings page, in Cloud tab,
there is a form for collecting credentials to cloud providers:

<Screen img="screen-settings-cloud.png" />

In the case of AWS, there are required `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key`.

## Preparing Cloud Environment

In case of AWS it is also required to assign proper permissions so
that Kraken can create or destroy EC2 instances. List of all requires
permissions looks as follows:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
                "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteKeyPair",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus"
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuration in Agents Groups

Having set credentials to cloud providers, it is possible now to
configure aspects of spawning new machines. This can be done on Kraken
-> Agents -> Groups page.  When a particular group is selected, then
its details will be presented on a separate tab. On this tab, there is
a section `Agents Deployment`. So the deployment can be manual
(default) or automated to particular cloud provider. In the case of
Amazon Web Services, there are the following options that can be set:

<Screen img="screen-agents-groups-cloud-aws.png" />

The meaning of the settings is as follows.

In **General** section:

**Region** - AWS region where a machine will be spawned

**Instances Limit** - maximum number of spawned machines at a time

**Default AMI Image** - if AMI image is not provided in job definition
  that this one is used

In **VM Options** section:

**Instance Type** - EC2 instance type that should be used for spawned
  machines, the full list is available on [AWS web
  page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

**Spot Instance** - indicates where Spot instance should be used ([AWS
  docs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/))

**Monitoring** - indicates if monitoring should be enabled ([AWS
  docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html))

**CPU Credits Unlimited** - this allows having more burst power, more
  in [AWS
  docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.html)

**Init Script** - a value of this text is passed as UserData to EC2
  instance, generally, this is a script that is executing during the
  first boot of instance ([AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html))

In **Destruction** section:

**Destroy VM after N jobs** - this indicates that the machine should
  be destroyed (terminated) after it is used in N Kraken jobs, default
  is 1, ie. machine is used once and then it is destroyed so each time
  a new fresh machine is used for each job; 0 means that this
  mechanism is disabled

**Destroy VM after N minutes of idle time** - this indicates that the
  machine should be destroyed (terminated) after it is not used in any
  Kraken jobs for a given number of minutes, default is 10 minutes,
  ie. a machine is destroyed if it sits idle for 10 minutes; 0 means
  that this mechanism is disabled

## Usage

Now when a job is assigned to an agents group with configured Agents
Deployment then a new machine will be spawned for that job if there
are no available agents.
