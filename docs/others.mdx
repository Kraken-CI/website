Kraken CI focuses on two main areas: executing builds and tests in a
distributed environment, and providing sophisticated test result
reporting and analytics. This article compares the Kraken CI system
with two types of competing tools:

1. [CI/CD systems](/docs/other-ci-systems) that typically do not prioritize test result analysis, and
2. [test result analysis tools](/docs/other-test-results-analysis-tools) that lack CI/CD execution capabilities.
