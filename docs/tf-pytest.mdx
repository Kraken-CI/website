## Intro

[Pytest](https://pytest.org/) framework for Python language makes it
easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional
testing for applications and libraries.

## Integration with Kraken CI

The following example shows how to execute Pytest tests in Kraken CI.
The presented workflow stage does:

1. pulls simple Python project,
2. runs Pytests tests cases one by one, and each test case result
   is reported to the Kraken server.

It is expected that Pytest is already installed in the system.

```python
def stage(ctx):
    return {
        "parent": "root",
        "triggers": {
            "parent": True,
        },
        "parameters": [],
        "configs": [],
        "jobs": [{
            "name": "pytest",
            "steps": [{
                "tool": "git",
                "checkout": "https://github.com/Kraken-CI/sample-project-python.git"
            }, {
                "tool": "pytest",
                "cwd": "sample-project-python",
                "params": "-vv",
                "pythonpath": "src"
            }],
            "environments": [{
                "system": "any",
                "agents_group": "all",
                "config": "default"
            }]
        }]
    }
```

section](schema#pytest).
