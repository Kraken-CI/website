## Intro

Maintaining a fixed number of machines for Kraken CI can be costly. If
there is no high traffic of builds, then some machines sit idle and
waste power. The solution to this problem is autoscaling ie. spawning
machines with Kraken Agents dynamically depending on the current needs
in the Kraken CI. If there is submitted a new flow with many building
or testing jobs, then new machines are spawned. When the flow
completes, machines are terminated and no costs are incurred.

Currently, Kraken CI autoscaling is supporting AWS EC2 virtual
machines, AWS ECS containers and Azure virtual machines.

The following chapters show how to configure access to AWS, then how
to configure parameters and behaviour of spawned machines in case of
AWS EC2. In the end, the usage in job definitions is presented.

Details about configuration for AWS as well as for Azure VMs can be
found in [the Kraken docs](autoscale-in-cloud).


## Global Cloud Settings

First, global settings have to be set to allow access to a given cloud
provider. In Web UI, on Kraken -> Settings page, in Cloud tab,
there is a form for collecting credentials to cloud providers:

<Screen img="screen-settings-cloud.png" />

In the case of AWS, there are required `Access Key` and `Secret Access
Key`. After filling in the values and saving settings, it is possible
to check if it works by clicking `Test Access` button.


## Preparing Cloud Environment

In the case of AWS it is also required to assign proper permissions so
that Kraken can create or destroy EC2 instances. The list of all requires
permissions looks as follows:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
                "ec2:CreateKeyPair",
                "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteKeyPair",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus"
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Configuration in Agents Groups

Having set credentials to cloud providers, it is possible now to
configure aspects of spawning new machines. This can be done on Kraken
-> Agents -> Groups page.  Let's create a new Agents Group by clicking
`Add New Group` button and naming it `aws-t2-micro`. The newly created
details will be presented on a separate tab. On this tab, there is a
section `Agents Deployment`. So the deployment can be manual (default)
or automated to a particular cloud provider. In the case of Amazon Web
Services, there are the following options that can be set:

<Screen img="screen-agents-groups-cloud-aws.png" />

Select any region that fits you. Limit of instances can be set to
2. This will not allow having more running machines than 2. For now,
the default AMI can be empty.

Then in VM options, let's stick to AWS free tier and select t2.micro
instance type. The rest of the checkboxes leave empty. Init script
also can be blank.

To ensure that dangling instances do not eat up our budget, let's set
the options in Destruction section to 1 job and 10 minutes. So a
spawned machine will be terminated after executing 1 job. And even
then, if it sits idle for more than 10 minutes, it will be destroyed as
well.


## Job Definition

Now, to use the defined `aws-t2-micro` Agents Group, we need to prepare
a project with a branch and a stage. More details about that can be
found in [Introductory Guide](/docs/guide-intro). So let's concentrate
now on defining a job.


```json
{
    "parent": "root",
    "triggers": {
        "parent": True
    },
    "configs": [],
    "jobs": [{
        "name": "hello",
        "timeout": 500,
        "steps": [{
            "tool": "shell",
            "cmd": "echo 'hello world'"
        }],
        "environments": [{
            "system": "ami-0967f290f3533e5a8",
            "agents_group": "aws-t2-micro",
            "config": "default"
        }]
    }]
}
```

There is no much difference comparing to regular Kraken jobs. The job
has a defined environments section where we are pointing to out
`aws-t2-micro` Agents Group. What's is new is `system` field which
points to `AMI` identifier - this indicates AWS EC2 image.

## Run

Now when a job is assigned to an agents group with configured Agents
Deployment then a new machine will be spawned for that job if agents
are no available in the Kraken.

Let's change the view to Branch Results view and trigger a new flow by
clicking `Run Flow` button. On the run page, the list of jobs shows our
AWS job:

<Screen img="screen-aws-job.png" />

That's it!
