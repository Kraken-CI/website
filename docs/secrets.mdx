Secrets are special variables that are protected. Their values are
never revealed in the Kraken UI. They are defined in projects and can
be added, modified, and deleted on the project web page under the
`Secrets` tab.

A new secret can be added by clicking the "New Secret" button. The
form located in the center of the web page allows users to provide the
secret details, such as the name of the secret, its type, and
values. There are two types of secrets:

- `Simple` secret - there is available just one simple secret value,
  it can be e.g. an access token
- `SSH Username and Key` secret - there are two values: username and a
  protected key

When the secret is defined, it can be used in the stage
definition. It can be placed in a workflow schema using variable
interpolation.

#### Example 1

In the project, there is a secret named `github_token` which is being
used here through string interpolation.

```python
    ...
    steps: [{
        "tool": "shell",
        "cmd": "echo $GITHUB_TOKEN",
        "env": {
            "GITHUB_TOKEN": "#{secrets.github_token}"
    }],
```

#### Example 2

This is a specific case. Some tools in particular fields expect just a
direct secret name. For example, the `git` tool expects the secret
name to be in the `access-token` field:

```python
{
    ...
    steps: [{
        "tool": "git",
        "access-token": "github_token",
        ...
    }]
}
```

More information about the usage of secrets can be found in
[Schema Data chapter, in Secrets section](schema-data#secrets).
