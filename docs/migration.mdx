## From 1.0 to 1.1

The method for accessing `arguments`, `secrets`, and `sequences` has
changed. However, the old way is still available for now, but it will
be removed in the future.

Previously, in the stage schema code, arguments were exposed only via
their name in string interpolation. Now they are available via
context, for example, `ctx.args.<arg-name>`, or via string
interpolation: `#{args.<arg-name>}`. More details can be found in
the
[Data in Schema chapter, User Parameters section](schema-data#user-parameters).

Secrets were also exposed just by their name with the prefix
`KK_SECRET_...` in string interpolation. Now they are available via
context, for example, `ctx.secrets.<arg-name>`, or via string
interpolation: `#{secrets.<arg-name>}`. More details can be found in
the [Data in Schema chapter, Secrets section](schema-data#secrets).

Sequences were previously exposed through special variables, such as
`KK_FLOW_SEQ` or `KK_CI_DEV_RUN_SEQ`, in string
interpolation. However, they are now available through the context,
such as `ctx.flow.seq.own`, or through string interpolation using
`#{flow.seq.own}`. Additional details can be found in the [Flow and
Run Sequences section of the Data in Schema chapter](schema-data#flow-and-run-sequences).
