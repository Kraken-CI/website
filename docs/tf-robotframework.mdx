## Intro

[Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) is a generic open
source automation framework. It can be used for test automation and
robotic process automation (RPA).

Robot Framework is actively supported, with many industry-leading
companies using it in their software development. Robot Framework is
open and extensible and can be integrated with virtually any other
tool to create powerful and flexible automation solutions. Being open
source also means that Robot Framework is free to use without
licensing costs.

Robot Framework has easy syntax, utilizing human-readable
keywords. Its capabilities can be extended by libraries implemented
with Python or Java. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it,
consisting of libraries and tools that are developed as separate
projects.

## Integration with Kraken CI

The following example shows how to execute RobotFramework tests in Kraken CI.
The presented workflow stage does:

1. pulls RobotFramefork project,
2. installs roboframework package using Python's pip tool,
3. runs RobotFramework tests generating results in JUnit format
4. collects results from JUnit file
5. and then stores generated reports by RobotFramework


```python
def stage(ctx):
    return {
        "parent": "root",
        "triggers": {
            "parent": True,
        },
        "parameters": [],
        "configs": [],
        "jobs": [{
            "name": "robot",
            "steps": [{
            	"tool": "git",
            	"checkout": "https://github.com/robotframework/RobotDemo.git"
            }, {
                "tool": "shell",
                "cmd": "python3 -m venv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install robotframework"
            }, {
                "tool": "shell",
                "cmd": "../venv/bin/robot --nostatusrc -x junit.xml *.robot",
                "cwd": "RobotDemo"
            }, {
                "tool": "junit_collect",
                "cwd": "RobotDemo",
                "file_glob": "junit.xml"
            }, {
                "tool": "artifacts",
                "cwd": "RobotDemo",
                "source": ["log.html", "report.html"],
                "report_entry": "report.html",
                "public": True
            }],
            "environments": [{
                "system": "krakenci/ubuntu:20.04",
                "executor": "docker",
                "agents_group": "all",
                "config": "default"
            }]
        }]
    }
```

Let's dissect the workflow to particular steps and explain them.

```python
    }, {
        "tool": "shell",
        "cmd": "python3 -m venv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install robotframework"
    }, {
```

This step prepares Python's virtualenv folder and then install
RobotFramework using pip to this venv.

```python
    }, {
        "tool": "shell",
        "cmd": "../venv/bin/robot --nostatusrc -x junit.xml *.robot",
        "cwd": "RobotDemo"
    }, {
```

This one starts RobotFramework int the folder with `.robot` files. It
also says to RobotFramework to not return error exit code in case of
failure using `--nostatusrc` switch as non-zero exit code would be
read by Kraken as an error of tests execution. And then `-x junit.xml`
switch indicates to store results in JUnit format in the indicated
file.

```python
    }, {
        "tool": "junit_collect",
        "cwd": "RobotDemo",
        "file_glob": "junit.xml"
    }, {
```

This step collects results stored in `junit.xml` file and uploads them
to Kraken CI server. More details about `junit_collect` tool can be
found in [its docs section](schema#junit-collect).

```python
    }, {
        "tool": "artifacts",
        "cwd": "RobotDemo",
        "source": ["log.html", "report.html"],
        "report_entry": "report.html",
        "public": True
    }],
```

And the last step takes generated HTML reports by RobotFramework and
uploads them to Kraken CI server indicating which document is an entry
one.

As a result of the execution of this stage in the Kraken's web UI,
there will be:

- set of test case results
- report about RobotFramework execution
