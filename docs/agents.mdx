Agent is a part of Kraken system. The place of agents in Kraken is
visualized in [Architecture chapter](/docs/architecture).

Agent is a piece of software that is installed on separate system.
It connects to Kraken server, gets jobs to execution and executes
them. A job can be executed in several ways. It depends on selected
executor indicated in job definition. A job may be executed:

- locally on current host system,
- inside Docker container,
- inside LXD container.

## Browsing Agents

In the top bar of UI, on right side, there is an `Agents` menu.
It can be used to find and manage agents.

The first position, `Agents`, allows for browsing active agents that
can execute jobs. The table of agents shows their address, the current
system where they are running, whether they are running on a
bare-metal host or in a Docker container, the capabilities of the host
system, and the currently running job, etc.

<Screen img="screen-agents.png" />

Clicking on the agent address leads to the agent page, which displays
the details of the agent. Here, it is also possible to assign an agent
to `Agent Groups`. These groups are used in job definitions in the
workflow schema to indicate which group an agent should be selected
from to execute the specified job.

## Agents Groups

The next menu option, `Groups`, allows for organizing agents into
groups. Grouping can be done arbitrarily and managed manually by an
administrator. This can be based on hardware features, host system
capabilities, and so on.

## Discovered Agents

The last menu option, `Discovered`, shows a list of agents that have
tried to connect to the Kraken server but are not authorized to do
so. Here, we can find newly set up agents and authorize them. Once
authorized, these agents can execute jobs, but it is recommended to
assign them to the appropriate groups first.

## Setting up a New Agent

There are several methods for setting up a new Kraken Agent. It can be
installed on a host system using an installation script. It can be
started as a Docker container. It is also possible to copy agent
binaries and set it up manually.

### Network Connections

While setting up a new agent, network connections need to be
considered. The Kraken Agent needs to have connections to several
services, which are outlined in the [Architecture
chapter](/docs/architecture). The required services include `Kraken
Server`, `MinIO`, and `ClickHouse`.

<Screen img="agent-connections.png" />

The address of the server must be passed to the agent binary using the
`-s` switch or via the `KRAKEN_SERVER_ADDR` environment variable. This
is handled by the installation script or is already embedded into the
Docker image with Kraken Agent.

In that moment, the addresses of MinIO and ClickHouse should be
acquired from the server. Unfortunately, if the Kraken Server is
started by Docker Compose, then the addresses of these services are
internal, i.e., from a subnet that was created by Docker Compose. The
services are published to the host using defined ports in the Docker
Compose YAML configuration file. Therefore, when the Kraken Agent is
started externally, the addresses for MinIO and ClickHouse need to be
provided manually. This can be done by defining environment variables:
`KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR` and `KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR`. More details about
setting them are provided in the next sections.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the Kraken Agent, the system needs to be
prepared. Actually, there are two dependencies that need to be
installed:

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/), at least version 3.8
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Once these dependencies are installed, we can proceed to install the
Kraken Agent.

### Installing by a Script

This method relies on an installation script that is hosted on the
Kraken server.

Make sure that in the Kraken Web UI, on the Kraken -> Settings page,
there is a URL to the Kraken Server set. Please copy and paste the URL
from the web browser into this field.

So now, a new agent can be installed. It involves downloading an agent
installer and running it. That's all.

The installation script can be downloaded from the Kraken Web UI ->
Agents -> Downloads menu option. There are two options: `For Linux`
and `For Windows`.

<Screen img="screen-agents-download.png" />

or via command line using `wget` - see below.

Agent Install steps:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

1. Download Kraken agent installer.

```console
$ wget http://<kraken-server-address>/install/kraken-agent-install.sh
```

2. Execute installer. It will use `sudo` internally so it requires rights to invoke `sudo`.

```console
$ chmod a+x kraken-agent-install.sh
$ ./kraken-agent-install.sh
```

This will download the latest agent from the Kraken server and install
it as a SystemD service on the host. The agent's files are installed
into the `/opt/kraken` directory. The state of the service can be
checked using `systemctl`:

```console
$ sudo systemctl status kraken-agent
● kraken-agent.service - Kraken Agent
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/kraken-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2021-03-11 17:09:16 UTC; 1 weeks 0 days ago
 Main PID: 699 (python3)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 6998)
   Memory: 14.5M
   CGroup: /system.slice/kraken-agent.service
           └─699 python3 /opt/kraken/kkagent -s http://localhost:6000/ -d /opt/kraken/data run
```

The Kraken Agent service is running but it may not see `MinIO` and
`ClickHouse` services. This can be configured in
`/opt/kraken/kraken.env` file.

Set `KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR` to the host where `clickhouse-proxy` is
running and add its listening port. If Kraken Server is started by
Docker Compose then use the address of the host. The port to
`clickhouse-proxy` should be taken from .env file or from docker
compose yaml file. Example:
`KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR=192.168.0.12:9001`.

Set `KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR` to the host where `minio` is running and add
its listening port. If Kraken Server is started by Docker Compose then
use the address of the host. The port to `minio` should be
taken from .env file or from docker compose yaml file. Example:
`KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR=192.168.0.12:9999`.

If Kraken Server was started by docker compose then the ports of these
services can be determined using `docker ps`. Example:

```console
$ docker ps | grep 'chproxy\|minio'
c17deb0b8fb7   127.0.0.1:5000/kkchproxy:kk_ver           ....  0.0.0.0:9001->9001/udp            kraken_clickhouse-proxy_1
b3e7c3aeeeb3   minio/minio:RELEASE.2020-12-18T03-27-42Z  ....  9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp  kraken_minio_1
```

where we can see that `clickhouse proxy` is exposed on 9001 port and
`minio` on 9999.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

1. Download Kraken agent installer.

```console
> powershell wget http://<kraken-server-address>/install/kraken-agent-install.bat
```

2. Execute installer. Run it as an `Administrator`.

```console
> kraken-agent-install.bat
```

This will download the latest agent from the Kraken server and install
it as a regular Windows service on the host. The agent's files are installed
into the `c:\kraken` directory. The state of the service can be
checked in PowerShell:

```console
PS> Get-Service kkagent

Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  kkagent            kkagent

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now the new agent can be authorized on the Kraken server. On the
"Discovered Agents" page, the IP address of the host with the new
agent should be visible. Select the checkbox and click the `Authorize`
button. Then, add the agent to the appropriate agent group. Now the
new agent will receive jobs for execution.

### Starting in Docker Container

In this case Kraken Agent is packed into Docker image and can be
started as Docker container.

The command to start a container is as follows:

```console
$ docker run -e KRAKEN_SERVER_ADDR=<host-addr>:6363 \
             -e KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR=<host-addr>:9001 \
             -e KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR=<host-addr>:9999 \
             --rm \
             us-docker.pkg.dev/kraken-261806/kkagent:<version>
```

where `<host-addr>` is a host address where given service is running.
If Kraken Server was started by `docker-compose` then the
`<host-addr>` is an address of the host where docker-compose has been
started. The ports above are default ports if the ports where changed
e.g. in docker compose .env file then the same ones should be used
here.

`us-docker.pkg.dev/kraken-261806/kkagent:<version>` is a location of Docker
image with Kraken Agent. The `<version>` identifies particular Kraken
version. The latest Kraken `<version>` can be found on a Kraken's
releases page in GitHub: https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases.
Example image URL: `us-docker.pkg.dev/kraken-261806/kkagent:0.406`.  Notice
that the version in the image URL does not have `v` prefix as on
GitHub page (v0.406).

### Starting in Docker Compose from QuickStart

It is also possible to extend Docker Compose from
[QuickStart](quick-start) and add there an agent or more.

There is already defined one built-in agent. But first, several
modifications are needed to solve IP addressing issues. The problem is
that it may get a different IP address after a container restart than
before. Kraken Server requires that the addresses do not change
otherwise it is not possible to identify agents by the Kraken Server.

First, open your compose file (e.g. kraken-docker-compose-X.Y.yaml)
and enable IP Address Management (IPAM) in the `lab_net` where all
agents reside:

```yaml
  ...
  lab_net:
    driver: bridge
    # add the following lines at the end of compose file
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

Here is added a subnet with particular addresses class,
`172.20.0.0/16`. You can define any subnet definition you need.

And now add extra agents by copy-pasting `agent` service:

```yaml
  agent1:
    restart: always
    image: us-docker.pkg.dev/kraken-261806/kk/kkagent:0.998
    environment:
      - KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR
      - KRAKEN_SERVER_ADDR
    networks:
      lab_net:
        ipv4_address: 172.20.0.11
    depends_on:
      - server
      - minio
      - clickhouse-proxy
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Important things:

1. New agent service name should be different e.g. `agent1`, `agent2`, etc.
2. Remove ` - KRAKEN_AGENT_BUILTIN=1` environment variable that can be only in one agent.
3. Add explicit IP address in `networks` section: `ipv4_address: 172.20.0.11`.
  Every new agent needs to have a different IP address.

Before running such a modified compose file, shut down the currently
running compose and delete `lab_net`.  To delete this network, first,
check if it exists:

```console
$ docker network ls
```

It should have name like this `<current-folder-name>_lab_net`. Please delete it:

```console
$ docker network rm <current-folder-name>_lab_net
```

Now you can start Docker Compose again. `lab_net` network will be
recreated with proper new settings:

```console
$ docker-compose --env-file kraken-X.Y.env -f kraken-docker-compose-X.Y.yaml up
```

Go to Discovered Agents page in Kraken Web UI and check if new agents
are present there.
