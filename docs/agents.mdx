Agent is a part of Kraken system. The place of agents in Kraken is
visualized in [Architecture chapter](architecture.md).

Agent is a piece of software that is installed on separate system.
It connects to Kraken server, gets jobs to execution and executes
them. A job can be executed in several ways. It depends on selected
executor indicated in job definition. A job may be executed:

- locally on current host system,
- inside Docker container,
- inside LXD container.

## Browsing Agents

In the top bar of UI, on right side, there is an `Agents` menu.
It can be used to find and manage agents.

The first position, `Agents` allows for browsing active agents that can
execute jobs. The table of agents shows their address, current system
where they are running, if they are running on bare-metal host or in
Docker container, what capabilities host system has, currently running
job, etc.

Clicking the agent address leads to agent page which shows Agent
details. Here, it is also possible to assign an agent to `Agents
Groups`. These groups are used in job definitions in workflow schema
to indicate from which group an agent should be selected to execute
indicated job.

## Agents Groups

The next menu position, `Groups`, allows for gathering agents
into groups. Grouping can be arbitrary and manually managed by
administrator. It can be by hardware features, host system
capabilities, etc.

## Discovered Agents

The last menu position, `Discovered`, shows list of agents that tried
to connect to the Kraken server but are not authorized to do so. Here
we can find newly setup agent and athorize it. From that moment it can
execute jobs but first it is good to assign this new agent to proper
groups.

## Setting up a New Agent

There are several methods for setting up a new Kraken Agent. It can
be installed on a host system using a installation script. It can be
started as a Docker container. It is also possible to copy agent
binaries and setup it manually.

### Network Connections

While setting up a new agent, network connections need to be
considered.  Kraken Agent needs to have connections to several
services. They are presented
in [Architecture chapter](architecture.md). The required services are:
`Kraken Server`, `MinIO` and `ClickHouse`.

The address of the server must be passed to agent binary using `-s`
switch. This is handled by install script or is already backed into
Docker image with Kraken Agent.

In that moment the address of MinIO and ClickHouse should be acquired
from the server. Unfortunatelly if Kraken Server is started by docker
compose then the addresses of these services are internal ie. from a
subnet that was created by docker compose. The services are published
to the host using defined ports in the docker compose yaml
configuration file. So when the Kraken Agent is started externally
then the addresses to MinIO and ClickHouse needs to be provided. This
can be done by defining environemnt variables:
`KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR` and `KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR`. More details about
setting them is provided in the next sections.

### Installing by a Script

This method relies on an install script that is hosted on Kraken server.

Make sure that in Kraken Web UI, on Kraken -> Settings page there is
URL to Kraken Server set (copy and paste URL from web browser to this
field).

So now a new Agent can be installed. It involves downloading an agent
installer and running it. That's all.

Agent Install steps:

1. Download Kraken agent installer:

```console
$ wget http://<kraken-server-address>/install/kraken-agent-install.sh
```

2. Execute installer:

```console
$ chmod a+x kraken-agent-install.sh
$ ./kraken-agent-install.sh
```

This will download the latest agent from Kraken server and install it
as a SystemD service on the host. Agent's files are installed into
`/opt/kraken` directory. The state of the service can be checked using
`systemctl`:

```console
$ sudo systemctl status kraken-agent
● kraken-agent.service - Kraken Agent
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/kraken-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2021-03-11 17:09:16 UTC; 1 weeks 0 days ago
 Main PID: 699 (python3)
    Tasks: 1 (limit: 6998)
   Memory: 14.5M
   CGroup: /system.slice/kraken-agent.service
           └─699 python3 /opt/kraken/kkagent -s http://localhost:6000/ -d /opt/kraken/data run
```

The Kraken Agent service is running but it may not see `MinIO` and
`ClickHouse` services. This can be configured in
`/opt/kraken/kraken.env` file.

Set `KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR` to the host where `clickhouse-proxy` is
running and add its listening port. If Kraken Server is started by
docker compose then use the address of the host. The port to
`clickhouse-proxy` should be taken from .env file or from docker
compose yaml file. Example:
`KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR=192.168.0.12:9001`.

Set `KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR` to the host where `minio` is running and add
its listening port. If Kraken Server is started by docker compose then
use the address of the host. The port to `minio` should be
taken from .env file or from docker compose yaml file. Example:
`KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR=192.168.0.12:9999`.

If Kraken Server was started by docker compose then the ports of these
services can be determined using `docker ps`. Example:

```console
$ docker ps | grep 'chproxy\|minio'
c17deb0b8fb7   127.0.0.1:5000/kkchproxy:kk_ver           ....  0.0.0.0:9001->9001/udp            kraken_clickhouse-proxy_1
b3e7c3aeeeb3   minio/minio:RELEASE.2020-12-18T03-27-42Z  ....  9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp  kraken_minio_1
```

where we can see that `clickhouse proxy` is exposed on 9001 port and
`minio` on 9999.

Now the new agent can be authorized in Kraken server. On Discovered
agents page there should be visible an IP address of the host with the
new agent. Select checkbox and click `Authorize` button. And then add
the agent to proper agent's group. Now the new agent will be getting
jobs for execution.

### Starting in Docker Container

In this case Kraken Agent is packed into Docker image and can be
started as Docker container.

The command to start a container is as follows:

```console
$ docker run -e KRAKEN_SERVER_ADDR=<host-addr>:6363 \
             -e KRAKEN_CLICKHOUSE_ADDR=<host-addr>:9001 \
             -e KRAKEN_MINIO_ADDR=<host-addr>:9999 \
             --rm \
             eu.gcr.io/kraken-261806/kkagent:<version>
```

where `<host-addr>` is a host address where given service is running.
If Kraken Server was started by `docker-compose` then the
`<host-addr>` is an address of the host where docker-compose has been
started. The ports above are default ports if the ports where changed
e.g. in docker compose .env file then the same ones should be used
here.

`eu.gcr.io/kraken-261806/kkagent:<version>` is a location of Docker
image with Kraken Agent. The `<version>` identifies particular Kraken
version. The latest Kraken `<version>` can be found on a Kraken's
releases page in GitHub: https://github.com/Kraken-CI/kraken/releases.
Example image URL: `eu.gcr.io/kraken-261806/kkagent:0.406`.  Notice
that the version in the image URL does not have `v` prefix as on
GitHub page (v0.406).
