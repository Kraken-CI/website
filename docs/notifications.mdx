Kraken CI can provide information about the state of the last build of
a branch in a project. It can either send notifications over Email,
Slack or GitHub PR, or present the current state using badges or
CCTray protocol.

## Notifications Sent per Build

## Presenting Current State

### Badges


The status badges indicate the current quality of a branch in a project.

There are three types of badges. They are indicating:

- building state (if there are no errors)
- tests results with fixes and regression counts
- issues count with a count of newly discovered issues

Links to the badges are available on a branch management page, in the
`Status Badge & CCTray` tab:

### CCTray

[CCTray](https://cctray.org) is a protocol that allows users to fetch
the current state of a branch using [dedicated
clientes](https://cctray.org/clients/).

Kraken CI exposes a URL for a given branch that can be put to such a
client. This URL is available on the same page as for badges i.e. on
a branch management page, in the `Status Badge & CCTray` tab:

Copy CCTray URL and paste it to a client e.g. [BuildNotify](https://anaynayak.github.io/buildnotify/):
