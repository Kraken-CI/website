Webhooks allows for integration between source code versioning system
and Kraken. This way a push to Git repository may trigger a CI or a pull/merge request a
DEV flow. Currently the supported Git hosting services are GitHub, GitLab and Gitea.

Webhooks configuration is located in a project web page, under `Web
Hooks` tab. There are switches that enable or disable receiving
webhook requests from a selected service.

When a webhook for a given Git hosting service is enabled then there
is provided a `URL` and a `secret` that should be set in a project
settings page for webhooks in this service. In Git hosting services
this page can be found:

- GitHub - `https://github.com/<user>/<project>/settings/hooks`
- GitLab - `https://gitlab.com/<user>/<project>/-/hooks`
- Gitea - `https://try.gitea.io/<user>/<project>/settings/hooks`.

On this page there are several fields that should be filled:

- `Payload URL` - set to URL from Kraken that was mentioned above,
- `Content Type` - set to `application/json`
- `Secret` or `Token` - take from Kraken, it was mentioned above.

In section `Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?`
select `Let me select individual events.` and then check `Pull
requests` and `Pushes`.

Now webhook can be saved. You may try to trigger testing request.
