## Overview

Webhooks allow Kraken to integrate with your source code versioning system. This enables automated workflows, such as triggering a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline when code is pushed or initiating a DEV flow when a pull/merge request is created.

Kraken currently supports webhooks from:

- **GitHub**
- **GitLab**
- **Gitea**

## Configuring Webhooks in Kraken

You can configure webhooks in the project settings under the **Web Hooks** tab. Here, you can enable or disable webhook requests from supported services.

When you enable a webhook for a given Git hosting service, Kraken provides a **Webhook URL** and a **Secret**. You need to configure these in your Git hosting provider’s webhook settings.

## Setting Up Webhooks in Git Hosting Services

To configure webhooks, navigate to the appropriate settings page in your Git hosting service:

| Git Hosting Service | Webhook Settings Page |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **GitHub** | `https://github.com/<user>/<project>/settings/hooks` |
| **GitLab** | `https://gitlab.com/<user>/<project>/-/hooks` |
| **Gitea** | `https://try.gitea.io/<user>/<project>/settings/hooks` |

### Required Fields

When adding a webhook in your Git hosting service, fill in the following details:

- **Payload URL**: Use the Webhook URL provided by Kraken.
- **Content Type**: Set this to `application/json`.
- **Secret or Token**: Use the secret provided by Kraken.
- **Events to Trigger**: Select **Let me select individual events**, then check:
  - **Pull Requests**
  - **Pushes**

### Special Case: Radicle

For Radicle integration, the setup process differs. Refer to the dedicated article: [Integration with Radicle](/blog/integration-with-radicle).

## Testing Webhooks

- **Beeceptor**: Use [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) to inspect webhook requests by creating an endpoint and replacing Kraken’s Webhook URL with it.
- **Pipedream RequestBin**: Use [Pipedream RequestBin](https://pipedream.com/requestbin) to capture and inspect webhook payloads in real time.
