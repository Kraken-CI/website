## Branch Results

The `Branch Results` page presents high level information about flows
and runs of given branch.. It organizes flows in rows. The top row
contains the latest flow. Each flow row contains list of boxes. Each
box contains information about a run of given stage. The order of
boxes with runs is chronological according to their start time.

## Run Box

The color of run box indicates final status of the run:

- red: one or more jobs finished with an error
- yellow: no errors in jobs but some test results failed or there are
  issues discovered in the code
- green: all jobs finished without error and there is no failures in
  tests and no issues in the code

A run box contains:

- data about execution: total number of scheduled jobs, number of
  erred jobs, etc.
- summary of testing: pass ratio, total, regressions and fixes counts, etc
- issues summary: total number of discovered issues, number of new issues

Example 1:

<Screen img="screen-run-box-1.png" />

This run has 1 successful job that reported tests results. There were
run 100 test cases, where 16 did not passed, so pass ratio is
16%. There were detected 15 regressions and 13 fixes. There are
failures so the box is yellow.

Example 2:

<Screen img="screen-run-box-2.png" />

This run has 4 job with no errors. Some of them that reported tests
results, the other ones reported issues. There were run 17 test
cases, where all passed, so pass ratio is 100%. There were
detected 15 issues in the code. There are issues so the box is yellow.

Example 3:

<Screen img="screen-run-box-3.png" />

This run has 2 job with no errors. In the reported tests results,
there are 100% passed test cases. No failures and no issues so the box
is green.

Example 4:

<Screen img="screen-run-box-4.png" />

This run has 4 job with 1 error. All tests reported are passed but
there could be not reported tests due to error in job execution. There
were detected 6 issues in the code. There is one erred job so the box
is red.

## Test Case Results Table

A job that performs testing reports test results. The test results are
visible on a `Run Results` page, in `Test Results` tab. They are
presented in a table.

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results.png" />

The table presents test case results in each row. They contain a details of the test case result:

- the result status
- a name of the test case
- job name and ID
- age, instability and relevancy
- values
- execution environment: system, agent group and actual agent and config

In Kraken test case result beside status can contain values. Valuas
are pairs: attribute and its value. They are also a result of a test
case but hold numbers. They can hold e.g. performance data or anything
similar to performance. These values are tracked over time. Kraken can
draw charts of values and do more things with them.

## Filtering Test Case Results

It is possible to filter test results by various attributes:

- by `Results Status` ie. `Passed`, `Failed`, etc.
- by `Result Change` ie. `Fixes`, `Regressions`, `New` and `No
  Changes`; the change is determined between current result and
  previous result from previous run
- by `Age` where age is a number of previous runs with the same result
  as in current run; so e.g. age 0 means that in previous run test
  case had different result than it has now (so these are regressions
  and fixes); age 1 means that current run and previous run has the
  same result but the result before previous one is different
- `New` is a shortcut to set `Age` between 0 and 0, ie. show changes
  that happend in last run (fixes + regressions)
- by `Instability` where instability is a count of result status
  changes in last 10 runs; if this is 0 then in the last 10 runs test
  case has the same result (it was pretty stable); if this is 10 then
  it means that in every run of the last 10 runs the status was
  changing comparing to previous one (it was very unstable)
- by `Test Case` name
- by `Job` name of ID

Example 1:

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results-regressions.png" />

Filtering by `Result Changes`: show only regressions. Regression means
a change from non-passed status to passed status.

Example 2:

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results-regressions-failures.png" />

Filtering by `Result Status` and `Result Changes`: show only failures
that are regressions.

Example 3:

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results-age.png" />

Filtering by `Age`: show only results in age between 2 and 3.

Example 4:

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results-instability.png" />

Filtering by `Instability`: show only results that have instability
greater than 7 i.e. very unstable test cases.

## Sorting Test Case Results

Test case results can be sorted. This can be done using several columns:

- name
- result
- change
- age
- instability
- relevancy

<Screen img="screen-run-test-results-sort-name.png" />

By default results are sorted by test case name.

One of the most important sorting order is by `relevancy`.
Relevancy is estimated according to this rules:

- 0 is initial
- +1 for not passed
- +1 for failure
- +1 for instability <= 3
- +1 for age < 5
- +1 for regression

This way the most relevant results get the highest score. They need an
attention.

## Test Case History

Each test case has its history of results. In the table with test case
results a link under test case name leads to a page dedicated to given
test case. This page presents a table with historical results of the
test case.

<Screen img="screen-test-case-history.png" />

There is another tab called `Charts` that shows these results on charts.

<Screen img="screen-test-case-charts.png" />

The left chart shows history of result status. The right one presents
history of values in time. Error bars are shown if there were run
multiple iterations and there were reported multiple values for given
attribute.
