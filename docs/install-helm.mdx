It is possible to install Kraken in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
using [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh).

## Pre-requisites

Several things are required to install Kraken using Helm.
In short:

- Kubernetes cluster and kubectl tool
- Helm tool


Helm is used to deploy several Kraken services and expose them to an external network.
These Kraken services are described in [Architecture chapter](architecture.md).


## Kubernetes Clusters

There are multiple ways for setting up a Kubernetes cluster. One of the easiest ones,
that is most often used for experimenting is Minikube. There are also managed
clusters like EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) in AWS.

This manual will show how to install Kraken CI in Minikube but the
steps are similar for other Kubernetes environments as well.


## Install in Minikube

First, download minikube from [https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

And then create a cluster:

```console
$ minikube start
```

Now you may install Kraken CI but first, lets add a repo with Kraken Helm charts:

```console
$ helm repo add kraken-ci https://kraken.ci/helm-repo/charts
$ helm repo update
```

and now install Kraken CI:

```console
$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace kraken \
  --debug --wait \
  --set access.method='external-ips' --set access.external_ips={`minikube ip`} \
  kraken-ci kraken-ci/kraken-ci
```

This command actually upgrades Kraken CI if it is already installed
but if it was not yet installed, then it installs it (this is
`--install` switch).

The switches `--create-namespace` `--namespace kraken` are installing
Kraken CI into `kraken` namespace. If the namespace does not exist,
then it is created.

This command waits until all Kraken services are started correctly
(`--wait` switch). The `--debug` switch makes the output much more
verbose.

The two `--set` switches set Kraken's chart configuration. Whole
the config can be present using the following command:

```console
$ helm show values kraken-ci/kraken-ci
```

In the upgrade command, there are set two fields:

- `access.method` which indicate what method should be used to expose
  Kraken services in Kubernetes; there are available the following
  options: `external-ips`, `node-port`, `load-balancer`
- `access.external_ips` which indicate what external IP should be used
  to access Kraken services; in the case above, an IP address of
  minikube is used (the curly brackets `{..}` are necessary because
  `access.external_ips` requires an array as an argument)

And then, there are two arguments at the end of the upgrade
command. The first one is `kraken-ci` and this is the installation
name of the chart - you can pick any name here. The second argument is
the name of Kraken's Helm repository that was added above and the name
of the chart in this repository: `kraken-ci/kraken-ci`.

When everything completes successfully, then at the end of the whole
output there should be presented short instruction about getting
the URL of Kraken service like that:

```
NOTES:
Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace kk-1 -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].port}" services ui)
  export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace kk-1 -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
  echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT
```

Now you may check if Kraken is working by visiting the URL
given by this code and by checking if Kubernetes is running Kraken's
services with this command:

```console
kubectl get all -n kraken
```

This will show Kraken's pods, services, deployments and replica sets.
